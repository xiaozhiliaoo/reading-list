reactive programming vs reactive system vs reactive architecture

Reactive Programming doesn't mean you have created a Reactive System

Reactive System: Reactive Microservice

A system that uses Reactive Programming is not necessarily Reactive.

Location Transport VS Transport Remoting

Reactive Architecture：DDD，Lagom

Reactive Architecture + DDD = same goal

Many of the guidelines and rules in Domain Driven Design are compatible with those in Reactive Architecture.
